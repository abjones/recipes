Add 3 lbs honey to 1 gallon carboy
Add water, filling carboy halfway
Cap carboy, shake until all honey is fully dissolved
Add more water, filling to the shoulder

Rehydrate 1 packet Lalvin 71b yeast in 125 mL with 6.25 g of GoFerm.
The water should be 104-109 deg F when the yeast is added. Allow to sit for 15 minutes.

When the 15 minutes are complete, pour small samples of the 1 gallon must into the rehydrated yeast every 5 minutes. This will "temper" your yeast, ensuring that the yeast are not shocked when added to the final must. When the yeast is within 10 deg of the must, pour the yeast slurry into the mead.

For the first week of fermentation, aerate your mead (shake the carboy with the top off) at least twice a day.

At 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours into the fermentation, add 0.75 tsp Fermaid O. This will provide necessary nitrogen to keep your yeast healthy.

After 4 weeks, the mead should be finished fermenting. Rack to a secondary container. 2 months later (or when ready by taste or clear), bottle and enjoy.
